# simple-latex-template
A simple LaTeX template for reports with plots and tables. See the ``tex`` file directly for some instructions. This is basically only a basic template including some of the packages I use but it's simple enough that it could probably be of use to others. Beside the inclusion of packages this is a faily standard article-based document. A list of the packages used and some useful notes:

* amsmath
* hyperref (to include links with \url)
* UTF8 encoding
* lmodern (modern fonts)
* French and English babel
* blindtext (for placeholder text)
* tikz
* pgfplots
* graphicx
* float
* booktabs
* pgfplotstable

It also includes examples on filling tables and plots using data from csv files.
